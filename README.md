An AD633-based Ring Modulator in Eurorack format (4HP)

This is based on a design by Roman Sowa, who has kindly allowed me to share this implementation for anyone to build.

It's a great, clean-sounding ring modulator featuring the excellent AD633 IC.
The board is a pretty simple build, with mostly 0603 components. Two footprints are provided for the AD633 IC, and you should choose either DIP or soic package to place. No BOM is provided but it's pretty easy to see what's needed from the schematic. The specific hardware needed is:

- 3 Thonkiconn jacks
- 1 10k vertical 9mm pot
- 2 100k pots
- 2 micromini 3-way switches


Eagle 6 format schematic, board, and panel files are included.

Zip files containing the board and panel gerbers are also included.

Note: Images show the 1.0 version of the board and panel, which have a couple of errors that are corrected in the 1.1 versions presented here. Both were ordered from JLCPCB, with the panel as an "aluminum pcb." The panel came back with white paint and raw aluminum text, which is the inverse of what I expected but it works for me.
